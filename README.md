The objective of this report is to explore the Solar Power 
Generation dataset available on Kaggle, perform 
exploratory data analysis on the dataset, and analyze the 
performance of the two solar power plants located in 
India. The report aims to understand the relationships 
between different features and their impact on power 
generation and to compare the efficiencies of the two 
power plants. The ultimate goal of the report is to provide 
insights and recommendations that can be useful for 
optimizing the performance of solar power plants
